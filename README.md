# Statistical analysis of predict students' dropout and academic success

In this project, the "Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success" dataset from Kaggle was selected. The dataset includes students' demographic information, socioeconomic factors and their performance in different courses. The column selected for the analysis is the "Course" column, which represents the course grade received by the students. This column was chosen because it is a numerical variable that can provide information about students' academic performance. Overall, this project aims to provide insights into students' academic performance by analysing the "Course" column data. By calculating descriptive statistics, identifying outliers, visualising the data and estimating population parameters, it can help us to better understand the distribution and characteristics of "Course" grades or marks.

## Project Stages:

#### Data Set Description and Why Selected: 
The dataset contains various student characteristics, including demographic information, socioeconomic factors, and academic performance indicators. The "Age at enrolment" column contains the student's age at the time of enrolment. I chose the "Predict student dropout and academic achievement" dataset and the "Age at enrollment" column because it contains quantitative data that better meets the project demands.

#### Average of Column Data: 
The mean of the "Age at enrollment" column is a measure of central tendency that helps us understand the typical age of students at the time of enrolment.

#### Median of Column Data: 
The median of the "Age at enrollment" column represents the middle value when the data is sorted. This provides a robust measure of central tendency that is not affected by extreme values or outliers.

#### Variance, Standard Deviation and Standard Error:
Variance measures the spread or variability of ages in the "Age at enrolment" column. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a more understandable measure of the dispersion of ages. The standard error estimates the variability of the sample mean.

#### Distribution Shape: 
The shape of the age distribution in the "Age at enrolment" column can be assessed by examining histograms or other visualisations. For my data set, the distribution pattern is skewed to the right (positive skewness).

#### Outliers: 
Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the overall age pattern in the "Age at enrolment" column. They can be identified using statistical measures such as the first and third quartiles and the inner quartile range, or visual inspection of the data. My data set contains outliers and these values are printed to the console.

#### Histogram and Box Plot: 
The histogram and box plot visualisations from the "Age at enrollment" column provide a graphical representation of the age distribution. Histograms show ages by frequency or number in different quartiles, while box plots show quartiles, median and outliers, which allows us to assess the spread, skewness and presence of extreme values in the data.

#### Confidence Interval: 
Confidence intervals for the mean and variance of the "Age at enrolment" column provide an interval where the population mean or variance is likely to be found. These intervals are calculated using statistical methods and help estimate the precision and reliability of sample-based estimates.

#### Sample Size Calculation: 
Includes a calculation to determine the sample size needed for future studies or surveys. By considering the desired margin of error, confidence level and standard deviation, the sample size required to obtain reliable estimates of the "Age at enrolment" column can be calculated.
