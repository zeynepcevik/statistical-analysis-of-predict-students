# Statistical analysis of predict students' dropout and academic success

In this project, the "Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success" dataset from Kaggle was selected. The dataset includes students' demographic information, socioeconomic factors and their performance in different courses. The column selected for the analysis is the "Course" column, which represents the course grade received by the students. This column was chosen because it is a numerical variable that can provide information about students' academic performance. Overall, this project aims to provide insights into students' academic performance by analysing the "Course" column data. By calculating descriptive statistics, identifying outliers, visualising the data and estimating population parameters, it can help us to better understand the distribution and characteristics of "Course" grades or marks.
